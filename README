vim-plain
---------

A (Neo)vim minimalistic color scheme, which emphasizes language and markup
structure with bold rather than color. Only comments and strings get a color
that differs from the body of a document/code file.

You can add further highlight groups (e.g., dap, telescope, gitsigns) at the end
of the file -- there's an example for MiniJump from mini.nvim [1]; only basic
plugins are actually configured. Note that I use the 'gui' attribute to define
many default settings. For instance, comments are defined as:

    call s:h('Comment', {'fg': s:comment, 'gui': 'italic'})

which means they should be italicized if you ':set termguicolors'. If your
terminal emulator doesn't offer an italic variant of your preferred font (e.g.,
this is the case for Fira Code), you can use a custom font instead. Here is what
I used with Alacritty (with font ligature patch):

    font:
      normal:
        family: Fira Code
        style: Regular
      bold:
        family: Fira Code
        style: SemiBold
      italic:
        family: Fira Code
        style: Medium
      size: 11.0

If you are after a good looking color scheme for your terminal, I can recommend
the base16 variants. I personnally settled on the following palette for my light
theme: (Alacritty syntax again)

    primary:
      background: "#fffcf1"
      foreground: "#2E3440"
    normal:
      black: "#fffcf1"
      red: "#a54242"
      green: "#8c9440"
      yellow: "#de935f"
      blue: "#5f819d"
      magenta: "#85678f"
      cyan: "#5e8d87"
      white: "#3B4252"
    bright:
      black: "#afa39e"
      red: "#cc6666"
      green: "#b5bd68"
      yellow: "#f0c674"
      blue: "#81a2be"
      magenta: "#b294bb"
      cyan: "#8abeb7"
      white: "#4C566A"

For dark theme, I warmly recommend the Nord theme [2].

At some point, we were able to auto-detect background color, especially in Tmux,
but the following Neovim hack [3] may no longer work depending on your terminal
settings. At least it seems to still work with Tmux 3.2a:

    vim.api.nvim_exec(
      [[
    if $TERM ==# "tmux-256color"
      lua vim.loop.fs_write(2, "\27Ptmux;\27\27]11;?\7\27\\", -1, nil)
    endif
    ]],
      true
    )

If this doesn't work, you will have to ':set background=<light|dark>' in your
config file when using Tmux. Otherwise, it should just work, e.g. in Gnome
terminal change your color theme while running (Neo)vim and update (Neo)vim
background.

This theme is inspired from the many mono or dichromatic themes listed at [4],
among others. Unfortunately I don't remember which one I started with.

A preview is available at [5].

For an even simpler colorscheme, have a look at mono.vim [6].
