vim-plain
---------

A (Neo)vim minimalistic color scheme, which emphasizes language and markup
structure with bold rather than color. Only comments and strings get a color
that differs from the body of a document/code file.

You can add further highlight groups (e.g., dap, telescope, gitsigns) at the end
of the file -- there's an example for MiniJump from nvim-mini; only basic
plugins are actually configured.

This theme is inspired from the many mono or dichromatic themes listed at
https://github.com/mcchrish/vim-no-color-collections, among others.
Unfortunately I don't remember which one I started with.
