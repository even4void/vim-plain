vim-plain
---------

A (Neo)vim minimalistic color scheme, which emphasizes language and markup
structure with bold rather than color. Only comments and strings get a color
that differs from the body of a document/code file.

You can add further highlight groups (e.g., dap, telescope, gitsigns) at the end
of the file; only basic plugins are actually configured.
