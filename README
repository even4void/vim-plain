vim-plain
---------

A (Neo)vim minimalistic color scheme, which emphasizes language and markup
structure with bold rather than color. Only comments and strings get a color
that differs from the body of a document/code file.

You can add further highlight groups (e.g., dap, telescope, gitsigns) at the end
of the file -- there's an example for MiniJump from nvim-mini; only basic
plugins are actually configured. Note that I use the 'gui' attribute to define
many default settings. For instance, comments are defined as:

    call s:h('Comment', {'fg': s:comment, 'gui': 'italic'})

which means they should be italicized if you ':set termguicolors'. If your
terminal emulator doesn't offer an italic variant of your preferred font (e.g.,
this is the case for Fira Code), you can use a custom font instead. Here is what
I used with Alacritty (with font ligature patch):

    font:
      normal:
        family: Fira Code
        style: Regular
      bold:
        family: Fira Code
        style: SemiBold
      italic:
        family: Fira Code
        style: Medium
      size: 11.0

If you are after a good looking color scheme for your terminal, I can recommend
the base16 variants. I personnally settled on the following palette for my light
theme: (Alacritty syntax again)

    primary:
      background: "#fffcf1"
      foreground: "#2E3440"
    normal:
      black: "#fffcf1"
      red: "#a54242"
      green: "#8c9440"
      yellow: "#de935f"
      blue: "#5f819d"
      magenta: "#85678f"
      cyan: "#5e8d87"
      white: "#3B4252"
    bright:
      black: "#afa39e"
      red: "#cc6666"
      green: "#b5bd68"
      yellow: "#f0c674"
      blue: "#81a2be"
      magenta: "#b294bb"
      cyan: "#8abeb7"
      white: "#4C566A"

For dark theme, I warmly recommend the Nord theme (https://www.nordtheme.com/).

At some point, we were able to auto-detect background color, especially in Tmux,
but the following Neovim hack (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/17070) no
longer seems to work, at least with Tmux 3.2a:

    vim.api.nvim_exec(
      [[
    if $TERM ==# "tmux-256color"
      lua vim.loop.fs_write(2, "\27Ptmux;\27\27]11;?\7\27\\", -1, nil)
    endif
    ]],
      true
    )

This means you have to ':set background=<light|dark>' in your config file if you
are using Tmux. Otherwise, it should just work, e.g. in Gnome terminal change
your color theme while running (Neo)vim and update (Neo)vim background
.

This theme is inspired from the many mono or dichromatic themes listed at
https://github.com/mcchrish/vim-no-color-collections, among others.
Unfortunately I don't remember which one I started with.
